# Poem-Generator-
This java project generates small rhyming poems using a word dictionary and a hashtable data structure. The program analyzes the dictionary and each word's phonetic values and sorts the words into groups that rhyme.  Any words that cannot rhyme with other words are removed from the dictionary. After the rhyming words have been sorted through the program generates poems based on the user inputs. The first argument is a seed for a random number generator and the second argument is the number of poems that should be generated.
